Objects & It's Internal Representation in Javascript
</div>

<div class="container" id="p1">
Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.<br><br>

These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types ( Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol ) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each ( depending on their types ). <br><br>

Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.<br><br>

An object is a reference data type.<br><br>
</div>

<div class="container" id="p1">
A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. <br><br>

You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:
<br><br>
"objectName.propertyName"
<br><br>
Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name ( which could be a normal variable ) and property name are case sensitive. 

<br><br>
You can define a property by assigning it a value. For example, let’s create an object named myCar and give it properties name like make, model, and year as follows:
<br><br>
 Sample Coding :<br><br>
" var myCar = new Object () ; "<br><br>
" myCar.model = ' Mustang ' ; "<br><br>
" myCar.year = 1969 ; "<br><br>
" myCar.make = ' Ford ' ; "
<br>
<br>

<br>
Unassigned properties of an object are undefined ( and not null ).
<br><br>
" myCar.color ; "
<br><br>

</div>

<div class="container" id="p1">

Properties of JavaScript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket notation. Objects are sometimes called associative arrays, since each property is associated with a string value that can be used to access it.
<br><br>
An object property name can be any valid JavaScript string or anything that can be converted to a string, including the empty string. However, Any property name that is not a valid JavaScript identifier ( for example, a property name that has a space or a hyphen, or that starts with a number ) can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.
<br><br>
In JavaScript, the "this" keyword refers to an object,

Which object depends on how "this" is being invoked (used or called).
<br>

<br>
In an object method, "this" refers to the object.<br><br>
Alone, this refers to the global object.<br><br>
In a function, this refers to the global object.<br><br>
In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.<br><br>
In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.<br><br>
Methods like call( ), apply( ), and bind( ) can refer "this" to any object.<br><br>
